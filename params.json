In the rest of the description, “multicast” always means sending a message to all app instances.\r\n* App uses **B-multicast**. It does not implement R-multicast.\r\n* You need to come up with an algorithm that provides total-causal ordering.\r\n* A content provider is implemented using SQLite on Android to store <key, value> pair.\r\n\r\n\r\n- We have fixed the ports & sockets.\r\n  - App opens one server socket that listens on 10000.\r\n  - We will use up to 3 AVDs. The redirection ports are 11108, 11112, and 11116. All three ports are hard coded.\r\n\r\n- Every message is stored in the provider individually by all app instances. Each message is stored as a <key, value> pair. The key should be the final delivery sequence number for the message (as a string); the value should be the actual message (again, as a string). The delivery sequence number should start from 0 and increase by 1 for each message.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test case 1\r\n\r\n* Main Activity has “Test1” button that triggers the test case.\r\n* When the button is clicked, it should create a thread that multicasts 5 messages in sequence. Multicasting of one message should be followed by 3 seconds sleep of the thread. This is just to make sure that messages can be spread from different emulator instances.\r\n* The message format should be “<AVD name>:<sequence number>”. <AVD name> is the emulator instance’s name, e.g., avd0, avd1, and avd2. <sequence number> is a number starting from 0 and increasing by 1 for each message. For example, if your first emulator instance multicasts 5 messages, then the messages should be “avd0:0”, “avd0:1”, “avd0:2”, “avd0:3”, and “avd0:4”.\r\n* With this test case, at least the following two ordering guarantees can be verified by just looking at the sequence of messages on each instance.\r\n    * Total ordering: every emulator instance should display the same order of message\r\n    * FIFO ordering: all messages from the same instance should preserve the local order. This should be preserved because causal ordering implies FIFO ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test case 2\r\n\r\n* Main Activity has “Test2” button that triggers the test case.\r\n* When the button is clicked, app multicasts one message. The message format is the same as the above test case.\r\n* Receiving of this first message triggers all app instances to multicast exactly two more messages. Unlike the test case 1, you should not introduce any extra delay between the messages.\r\n    * Thus, in total with 3 AVDs, there should be 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 multicast messages.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[1] Read about Multicast [here](http://www.cs.odu.edu/~cs778/jeffay/Lecture7.pdf)\r\n\r\n[2] Single best resource on Android, [Android dev](http://developer.android.com)\r\n\r\n[3] Message ordering, [here](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~ajayk/Chapter6.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n#### Test Case 1:\r\n\r\n![Test Case-1](https://raw.github.com/adilansari/Group-Messenger/master/screen/test-1.png)\r\n\r\n#### Test Case 2:\r\n\r\n![Test Case-2](https://raw.github.com/adilansari/Group-Messenger/master/screen/test-2.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n##Contact\r\n\r\n* [E-mail](mailto: me@adilansari.com)\r\n* [@adilansari](http://twitter.com/adilansari)\r\n* [HomePage](http://www.adilansari.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
